Using This Code in Android Studio
---------------------------------

It is assumed that Android Studio has been installed and configured for Android development. To install and set up Android Studio for Windows see the article http://tekeye.uk/android/android-studio-windows-install or view the page http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html on the Android Developers website.

1. Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder on the system preserving directory structure. The extracted project will remain in that location.

E.g. If projects are stored in C:\android-projects then extract the zip file to that location, creating C:\android-projects\MyAndroid directory.

2. Run Android Studio.

3. Return to Studio's Welcome screen by closing any open projects.

4. Select Import project.

5. Browse to the MyAndroid directory.

6. Select the build.gradle file and click OK.

7. Configure the Gradle settings by clicking OK on the Gradle Sync message.

8. Wait for the IDE to finish configuring the project, view the bottom status bar for progress.

9. The project should then be ready to run. If not Studio will show any errors that need addressing. If you see a Rendering Problems message see http://tekeye.uk/android/android-studio-rendering-problems
